    "# Encode as String\n",
    "Sometimes it is very important to handle different input object types differently in a function. This problem will exercise your understanding of types, control-flow, dictionaries, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to encode a sequence of Python objects as a single string. The following describes the encoding method that we want to use for each type of object. Each objectâ€™s transcription in should be separated by \" | \", and the result should be one large string.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the object is an integer, convert it into a string by spelling out each digit in base-10 in this format: 142  one-four-two; -12  neg-one-two.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the object is a float, just append its integer part (obtained by rounding down) the same way and the string \"and float\": 12.324  one-two and float.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the object is a string, keep it as is.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the object is of any other type, return '`<OTHER>`'.\n",
